# Dancing Clouds

### Audio reactive visual project. We play a music track, get it's spectrum, and use it to control a point cloud.

This is a work in progress, bugs are to be expected, also I deviated the Object Oriented flow sometimes.

### Preview

The dancing clouds example from the Mastering Openframeworks Book.

I made a few subtle changes like, like using the newer function names and passing the song/sound track as the first argument.

### Build and Run

```
# from the openFrameworks/apps/myApps/dancingCloud folder

# build
make

# run
# a folder containing sounds are also read
./bin/dancingCloud /path/to/your/soundfile or folder
```
