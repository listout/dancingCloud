# Dancing Clouds

![](screens/screen.png)

The dancing clouds example from the Mastering Openframeworks Book.

I made a few subtle changes like, like using the newer function names and passing the song/sound track as the first argument.

To run

```
# from the openFrameworks/apps/myApps/dancingCloud folder
./bin/dancingCloud /path/to/your/soundfile
```
